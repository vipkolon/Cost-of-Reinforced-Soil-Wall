# 1. Problem Description

Reinforced Soil Wall is considered to be the best retaining structure due to cost-effectiveness and technical superiority over other retaining structures. It may be designed for 120 years and is dynamically stable as it can withstand eartquakes of high magnitudes.

This document analyses the budgetary cost of reinforcing material for a reinforced soil wall for varying geometry, soil profiles, surcharge loads and different reinforcing materials. The exact estimation involves rigorous designing for cost optimization using design codes and costing may vary due to its dependency on geometrical, soil profile, surcharge loads and type of reinforcing material used and thus requires considerable engineering expertise, time and money. However, various agencies concerned with the project like civil contractor, estimation engineer and consultant may like to have a quick and nearly accurate estimate for quoting, preparing tender or optimization using appropriate reinforcing material without incurring cost and time overrun.  

Exhaustive data on costing of reinforced soil wall has been compiled using various design codes (BS 8006, FHWA), different geometries, soil profiles, surcharge loads and reinforcing materials. This data has been different reinforced soil walls of heights varying between 3 m and 20 m, angle of internal friction ($\phi$) varying from 25 degree to 40 degree, surcharge from 14 kN/m2 to 24 kN/m2, unit weight of soil ($\gamma$) varying from 14 kN/m3 to 24 kN/m3, vertical spacing of reinforcement varying from 200 mm to 900 mm, and reinforcement material in form of polymeric strips, geogrids and woven geotextiles. The cost of reinforcing material comprises of market prices of different grades of material based on their ultimate tensile strength and their relative proportions being used in wall. This cost has been normalized in units of USD/sqm of facia area of wall based on current market prices of reinforcing material. This normalized cost can be varied based on variation in market rates.
